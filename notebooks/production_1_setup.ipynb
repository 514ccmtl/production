    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Working with code in production is hard. Rarely we will have a chance to work on a greenfield development and will get a chance to define all of its specifications.\n",
    "+ Sometimes, we may be offered the option of scraping a system and starting from scratch. This option should be considered carefully and, most of the time, rejected.\n",
    "+ Working with legacy code will be the norm:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Legacy code includes our own code.\n",
    "    - Legacy code may have been written by colleagues with different approaches, philosophies, and skills.\n",
    "    - Legacy code may have been written for old technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Most of the time, legacy code works and *this* is the reason we are working with it.\n",

    "## Software Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Software entroy is the natural evolution of code towards chaos.\n",
    "+ Messy code is a natural consequence of change:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Requriements change.\n",
    "    - Technology change.\n",
    "    - Business processes change.\n",
    "    - People change.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Software entropy can be managed. Some techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Apply a code style.\n",
    "    - Reduce inconsistency.\n",
    "    - Continuous refactoring.\n",
    "    - Apply reasonable architectures.\n",
    "    - Apply design patterns.\n",
    "    - Testing and CI/CD.\n",
    "    - Documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ *Technical debt* is future work that is owed to fix issues with the current codebase.\n",
    "+ Technical debt has principal and interest: complexity spreads and what was a simple *duct tape* solution becomes the source of complexity in downstream consumers.\n",
    "+ ML systems are complex: they involve many components and the interaction among those components determines the behaviour of the system. Adding additional complexity by using poor software development practices can be avoided.\n",
    "+ Building ML Systems is most of the time a team sport. Our tools should be designed for collaboration."

    "# Repo File Structure\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A few notes on the file structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `./data/` is a general data folder which is generally subdivided in a namespace. \n",
    "    \n",
    "        * This is an optional component and meant to hold development data or a small feature store.\n",
    "        * Include in `.gitignore`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - `./env/` is the Python virtual environment. It is included in `.gitignore`.\n",
    "    - `./logs/` is the location of log files. It is included in `.gitignore`.\n",
    "    - `./src/` is the source folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "        * Contains most of the modules and module folders.\n",
    "        * It is the reference directory to all relative paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `./src/.env` contains environment variable definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "        * We will add settings to this file and read them throughout our setup.\n",
    "        * A single convenient location to maintain connection strings to DB, directory locations, and settings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `./readme.md` a description of the project and general guidance on where to find information in the repo.\n",
    "    - `./requirements.txt` Python libraries that are required for this repo.\n",
    "    - `./.gitignore` includes all files that should be ignored in change control. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Git and Github\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.\n",
    "+ If you have not done so, please get an account on [Github](https://github.com/) and setup SSH authentication:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check for [existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys).\n",
    "    - If needed, create an [SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).\n",
    "    - [Add SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account) to your Github account.\n",

    "* Things to avoid putting in a repo: Personal Identity Information (PII), passwords and keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version Control System Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Commit early and commit often.\n",
    "+ Use meaningful commits:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The drawback of commiting very frequently is that there will be incomplete commits, errors and stepbacks in the commit messages. Commit messages include: \"Committing before switching to another task\", \"Oops\", \"Undoing previous idea\", \"Fire alarm\", etc.\n",
    "    - In Pull Requests, squash commits and write meaningful messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Apply a branch strategy.\n",
    "+ Submit clean pull requests: verify that latest branch is merged and review conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commit Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Clear commit messages help document your code and allow you to trace the reaoning behind design decisions. \n",
    "+ A few guidelines for writing commit messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use markdown: Github interprets commit messages as markdown.\n",
    "    - First line is a subject:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * No period at the end.\n",
    "        * Use uppercase as appropriate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Write in imperative form in the subject line and whenever possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Do:  \"Add connection to db\", \"Connect to db\"\n",
    "        * Do not:  \"This commit adds a connection to db\", \"Connection to db added\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The body of the message should explain why the change was made and not what was changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Diff will show changes in the code, but not the reasoning behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Same rules apply for Pull Requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Many of these points are taken from [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) by Chris Beams."
