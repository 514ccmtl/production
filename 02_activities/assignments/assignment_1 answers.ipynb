    "It would have been better to use Dask for a number of reasons, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Dask is designed to handle larger-than-memory datasets. If the dataset is very large, Dask can process it in chunks without loading everything into memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel processing: Dask can leverage multiple cores or even a cluster of machines to perform computations in parallel, potentially speeding up the calculation for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy evaluation: Dask uses lazy evaluation, which means it builds up a task graph of operations and only executes when necessary, which makes running the computation more efficient especially for complex chains of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Keeping the data in Dask format throughout the pipeline maintains consistency and allows for easier integration with other Dask operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large datasets: Dask can be more useful and run more efficiently for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case, given that we're dealing with financial time series data that could potentially be quite large, it would likely have been better to perform the rolling average calculation in Dask"
