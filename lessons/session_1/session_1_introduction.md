## What is ML?

::::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

“A computer program is said to learn from experience *E* with respect to some class of tasks *T* and performance measure *P*, if its performance at tasks in *T*, as measured by *P*, improves with experience *E*.”

(Mitchel, 1997)

## What is ML?

Machine Learning (ML) is a collection of methods that allow a computer to:

+ **Learn autonomously** to perform a task based on patterns in a set of examples without being explicitly programmed.
+ **Gain from experience** such that the method performs better in the measure that it observes additional examples.
+ **Generalize results** beyond the data used for training the method.

## Why Use Machine Learning?


::::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

+ ML is used when a task is too complex or too impractical to program explicitly.
+ When applied successfully, ML will enable:

    - Greater scale: automation.
    - Better performance.
    - Doing things that were not possible before.
