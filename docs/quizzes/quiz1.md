 Quiz 1 - Introduction to ML Systems
1. Machine learning can solve virtually any problem.
True
False

2. The fundamental requirements of any Machine Learning System are:
Optimality
Efficiency
Maintainability
Adaptability
Independence
Scalability
Reliability

3. Some problems that could be solved with Machine Learning methods can be approached better using other, potentially simpler methods.
True
False

4. The only thing that we require from Machine Learning systems in business is high-quality predictions.
Yes, we only care about predictions.
No, some use cases require model explanations, fair and ethical decisions, or informativeness, which can be more important than the quality of predictions.

5. Informativeness is:
The quality of a model that allows it to reduce the dimensionality of the data set, making it a more efficient information store.
The quality of a model that allows it to provide accurate predictions based on the information content of a data set.
The quality of a model that allows it to provide additional information about its results, including sensitivities to features, feature importance, and uncertainty of prediction.
Informativeness is not a quality of a model.

6. Predicting the city's economic growth (in CAD) of having a Taylor Swift concert in Toronto is an example of:
A regression problem
A binary classification problem
A multiclass classification problem
A multilabel classification problem

7. Business problems and machine learning problems always have the same objectives, that is why machine learning is so popular today.
True
False

8. A Machine Learning model is:
The interfaces that connect data and the learning algorithm
The data used in model development
The algorithm's logic
The predictions that the model produces
The user interface, including visual design elements
The code that implements the algorithm

9. Log Loss is a performance metric that ignores prediction scores or probabilities.
True
False

10. Any machine learning algorithm does all of the following (select all that apply):
Gain from experience.
Generalize results.
Prescribe solutions to a problem.
Learn from examples.
Determine the causes of an observed event.
Provide interpretable results.
